# novel-scraper-2

A basic web scraper that works on the site https://www.lightnovelworld.co/ using python & selenium.

To use:
```python
pip install selenium
pip install tqdm
```
Features of this script as of 5/2/24:
- Search for novels within the site
- Save all novel chapter content as Text Files into it's own folder
- Saves the novel image as well

Looking to implement more features :)
